# What is The Metaverse Carnival?
Hey there!! The Metaverse Carnival is our attempt at de-centralized VR game development. This is an open-source VR game made entirely by the community. The game will immerse you in that nostalgic carnival vibe. Walk around, play games, (maybe even hang out with other people in multiplayer?) and loads more. This world is really our oyster and we can create the coolest carnival this side of the metaverse!
